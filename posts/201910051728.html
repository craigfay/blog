<h1>Ray Dalio's "All Weather Portfolio"</h1>

<p>Ray Dalio, billionaire founder of the firm Bridgewater Associates, and predictor of the 2008 financial crisis, describes a portfolio allocation strategy he calls the "All Weather Portfolio", which he claims can thrive in any economic climate. Here's how it looks:</p>

<ul>
  <li>30% Stocks</li>
  <li>40% Long term treasury bonds</li>
  <li>15% Intermediate term treasury bonds</li>
  <li>7.5% Commodities</li>
  <li>7.5% Gold</li>
</ul>

<p>Conventional wisdom says that an under-representation of stocks would prevent such a portfolio from being competitive. Despite this, it's been back-tested against past markets, producing shockingly impressive performance. I had already been massively influenced by both his Ray's book, <a href="https://www.principles.com/">Principles</a>, and his conceptual model of the <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PHe0bXAIuk0">economic machine</a>, so I wanted to understand the process behind the AWP, and see if I could come to a similar conclusion.</p>
